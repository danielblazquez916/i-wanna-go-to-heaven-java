## Project Description:

<p>I Wanna Go To Heaven is a challenging 2D platformer inspired by the classic I Wanna Be The Guy, a game known for its extreme difficulty.
This project was mainly a personal experiment to practice pure Java game development, built entirely using internal Java libraries without external engines or frameworks.

Although it’s an older project and some design choices might not be ideal by today’s standards, it includes several interesting mechanics:</p>

## Features:
<ul>
<li>Double-jump physics</li>
<li>Enemies and deadly spikes</li>
<li>Physics-based crate</li>
<li>NPCs with branching dialogue trees</li>
<li>Humorous references to friends and internet classics</li>
<li>A final boss inspired by SrPelo, a well-known online animator</li>
</ul>

<p>Visuals are intentionally quirky and textures are simple but give the game personality.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> This was a learning project, so some patterns and implementations may not follow modern best practices.</p>
